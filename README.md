# Matlab-Gui-Radiation-pattern-Dipole-Antenna-Array
Matlab Gui : Radiation pattern of Dipole &amp; Antenna Array
Project: Designing the #RadiationPattern of the standard #Dipole antennas with different lengths and the extraction of different Characteristics such as HPBW and in the second part: the various #antennaArray (#phasedAntenna) configurations in a #MatlabGUI.

 ✔️Dipoles: Short, Half-wave, Full wave & variable length Dipole (with #HPBW )
 
 ✔️Antenna Array (phased Antenna) with variable parameters: Number of elements, Distances, phase gradient.
